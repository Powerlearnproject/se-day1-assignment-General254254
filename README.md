#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is the application of engineering principles to software development, ensuring reliability, scalability, and maintainability.
-Software engineering enables systems to grow efficiently while maintaining performance and stability.
-It ensures that software functions correctly and can withstand failures or high loads.
-Proper engineering practices improve software performance and resource utilization.
-It facilitates the development of new technologies and digital advancements.
-Software engineering incorporates security measures to protect data from cyber threats.
-It enables teamwork among developers, designers, and other stakeholders in large projects.
-Rigorous testing and maintenance ensure high-quality and defect-free software.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

-The 1968 NATO Conference introduced structured development practices to tackle the increasing complexity and unreliability of software.
-In the 1970s, code maintainability and reliability improved significantly through the implementation of clear control structures, which helped to minimize chaotic coding practices.
-In 2001, software development was transformed by adopting iterative, flexible, and collaborative approaches, moving away from the traditional waterfall models.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning – Defines project goals, scope, requirements, and resources, creating a detailed plan with risk analysis.
Feasibility Study – Evaluates technical, financial, operational, and legal viability to determine if the project should proceed.
System Design – Develops the system’s architecture and detailed design for components and features.
Development – Involves coding the software based on the design specifications.
Testing – Ensures the software meets standards, is bug-free, and functions correctly through various tests.
Deployment – Releases the tested software to users, possibly in stages.
Maintenance – Monitors, updates, and fixes issues after deployment based on user feedback and business needs.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
-Waterfall follows a sequential, phase-based process, whereas Agile evolves through iterative cycles.
-Waterfall is rigid, making changes difficult once a phase is completed, whereas Agile is highly adaptable, allowing frequent modifications.
-Waterfall requires extensive upfront documentation, while Agile focuses more on working software with minimal documentation.
-In Waterfall, testing is conducted after the development phase is completed, whereas Agile integrates continuous testing throughout the process.
-Client involvement in Waterfall is limited until the final product is delivered, while Agile keeps clients actively involved throughout.
-Waterfall delivers the entire product at the end, whereas Agile releases product increments at regular intervals (sprints)

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
